=BIRDIE=

 Once in overview mode, jump to any win with one single key.
 jump to any workspace with one key.
 open any dash item with one key.
 press space to come back to normal gnome shell overview.

 it makes sense to use some launcher alltogether with birdie
 eg some dmenu
 someone to code a demenu-like shell extension?? thks

=ROADMAP=

+lie+ roadmap

  - switching windows = seems ok.
  - allow to use normal shell runner = seems ok
  - include shortcuts for dash = seems ok
  - include shortcuts for workspaces
  - make something with search entry
  - allow to move apps?
  - handle more than 26 bindings
  - maybe settings to activate bindings case by case
  - maybe more, eg close app key making overview stay there

=ABOUT=

+throw flowers+ about

 Birdie is inspired by emacs ace-jump
 (which was inspired from some vim plugin)
 and allows to navigate text instantly.

 however most code comes from official "WindowNavigator" extension.

 why /Birdie/?
 if you didn't know a "birdie" is a -1 @ golf. check wikipedia.
 (albeit the only golf i ever played is vim golf)
