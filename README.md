 * once in overview mode, jump to any win with one key.
 * jump to any workspace with one key.
 * open any dash item with one key.
 *
 * i would probably use some launcher alltogether with birdie

ROADMAP
(a roadmap is not a promise, rather a lie)

 * switching windows = seems ok.
 * make something with search entry
 * allow to use normal shell runner
 * include shortcuts for dash
 * include shortcuts for workspaces
 * allow to move apps? 
 * maybe close app key making overview stay there
